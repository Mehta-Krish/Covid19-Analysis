<h1>Covid-19 Analysis</h1><br>
The COVID-19 Case Study is a comprehensive data analysis project focused on understanding the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The project uses real-world datasets to analyze patterns in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries across countries and regions.
                    <br><br>The 3 key datasets used in this project: Confirmed cases dataset, Deaths dataset & Recovered cases dataset, each representing cumulative daily values from January 22, 2020, to May 29, 2021, covering 276+ geographic regions.
                    <br><br>The Goal of the project is to analyze how COVID-19 spread over time, identify trends in daily confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, and compare these trends across different countries.

                    <br><strong><h3>🐱 Insights :</h3></strong><hr><ol>
                    <li> <strong>Global Spread & Top Countries :</strong><ul>
                            <li> The United States recorded the highest cumulative confirmed cases.
                            <li> India and Brazil followed with sharp surges, especially in early and mid-2021.
                            <li> China showed early growth but stabilized rapidly by Feb–Mar 2020.</ul>
                    <li>  <strong>Peak Case Insights (Germany, France, Italy) :</strong><ul>
                            <li> France experienced the highest single-day spike among the three.
                            <li> Major peaks occurred during late 2020 and early 2021, aligning with Europe's second wave.
                            <li> Italy showed early severe peaks due to the initial European outbreak.</ul>
                    <li>  <strong>Daily New Cases & Wave Patterns –</strong> Most countries showed sharp increases during lockdown relaxations, drops after public health interventions, with daily new cases revealing hidden spikes not visible in cumulative data.
                    <li>  <strong>Recovery Rate Comparison (Canada vs Australia) –</strong> Canada had a higher recovery rate (84.47%), while Australia showed (79.38%) inspite of having less confirmed cases.
                    <li>  <strong>Death Rate Distribution (Canada's provinces) –</strong>Quebec and other densely populated provinces had higher death rates, whereas sparsely populated regions showed lower transmission and lower fatality ratios.
                    <li>  <strong>Monthly Progression – US, Brazil, Italy & India :</strong><ul>
                            <li> <b>US:</b> Showed multiple strong waves, with major peaks in late 2020 and early 2021. Deaths and cases rose sharply during winter months.
                            <li> <b>Brazil:</b> Exhibited consistently high monthly cases and deaths, with one of the most severe rises during 2021, reflecting prolonged transmission.
                            <li> <b>Italy:</b> Early strong peak in March–April 2020, followed by a second major surge in late 2020 aligned with Europe’s second wave.
                            <li> <b>India:</b> Moderate early spread, but a massive spike in cases and deaths during the 2021 second wave, dominated by the Delta variant.</ul>
                    <li>  <strong>Highest Average Daily Deaths –</strong> The countries with the highest daily mortality load were: United States, Brazil, India, Mexico, and the United Kingdom.
                    <li>  <strong>Recovery vs Death Outcomes (South Africa) –</strong> South Africa shows a very high recovery-to-death ratio, with recoveries far exceeding deaths.
                    <li>  <strong>US Recovery Trend (2020–2021) –</strong> Early 2020 had low recovery ratios due to testing delays and slow reporting, while late 2020 to early 2021 showed improved recovery ratios reflecting better treatment protocols and healthcare adaptation.
                    <li> <strong>Overall COVID Impact (2020–2021) –</strong> Global death rates decreased after mid-2020 as treatment improved, recovery rates increased across countries by 2021</ol>
